# Neutral Block Initiative

> A framework for balanced governance through neutral participation.

---

## 🧩 About
The Neutral Block Initiative explores a new form of representative governance that avoids the pitfalls of strict bipartisan systems.  
It proposes a “neutral block” — a nonpartisan core in the decision-making process — designed to encourage collaborative reform, leadership diversity, and policy resilience.

Our mission is to provide open frameworks, draft charters, and community-led discussions to help societies evolve beyond polarized political models.

## 🌐 Vision
